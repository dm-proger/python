# School
#
# Make a class structure in python representing people at school.
# Make a base class called Person, a class called Student, and another one called Teacher.
# Try to find as many methods and attributes as you can which belong to different classes,
# and keep in mind which are common and which are not. For example, the name should be a Person attribute,
# while salary should only be available to the teacher.
