# Letter Counter

# Given a string as input, you need to output how many times each letter appears in the string.
# You decide to store the data in a dictionary, with the letters as the keys, and the corresponding counts as the values.
# Create a program to take a string as input and output a dictionary, which represents the letter count.
#
# Sample Input
# hello
#
# Sample Output
# {'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 1}


# import collections
#
# def count_occurencies():
#
#     input_var = list(input(" "))
#     occurrences = collections.Counter(input_var)
#     print(dict(occurrences))
#
# count_occurencies()
